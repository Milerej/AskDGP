The Digital Governance Platform (DGP) is designed to transform Whole-of-Government ICT and SS Governance, with the goal of effectively managing ICT risks and enhancing the delivery of digital services.
The IT Service Management (ITSM) platform serves as the central system for agency users to report DGP-related issues or submit inquiries. Currently, a lean DGP Operations team manages initial ticket resolution by leveraging their expertise, historical responses, and available resources. Complex issues are escalated to Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), including Product Teams, Process Owners, Module Owners, and Technical Teams.
This process heavily relies on manual intervention to review historical responses to similar inquiries. Additionally, it may require referencing relevant resources (e.g., manuals, user guides, forms, notices, and announcements) available on the DGP Portal, which can be time-consuming and inefficient.
